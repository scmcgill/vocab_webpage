## to-do
- add another table for grammatical info?
  - base off lemma.id?
    - language_part_of_speech:
- reset default ports for http/sql?
  - is that a thing for httd/sql?
- separate code into chunks and make a more orderly directory, with subdirectories for langs/functions
  - use SQL scripts instead of invoking query from page?
- generate table from query output instead of having rendered as paragraphs
- how to validate the INSERT statements with PHP to avoid collision in the database?
  - do a SELECT statement and check against that?
    - would require reading from the db every time, but I may need to do that anyway if I want the INSERT statements to show upon the page after a successful update
- copy to termux?
  - bash script for simple select?
  - limited privileges for android user
